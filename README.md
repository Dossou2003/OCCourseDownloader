## Usage

## Enjoy

After you have successfully downloaded a course, you might want to browse the course either as HTML or as Markdown.

I'd personnally recommend [Typora](http://typora.io) as a Markdown editor/reader <3. At the time of writting, it is still *free* in beta version, so you might just hop on the occasion.
